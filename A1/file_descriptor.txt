Problem 2:

There are 3 standard file descriptors;

stdin (0) - File descriptor 0, used for input from keyboard.
stdout (1) - File descriptor 1, used for output to the terminal or console.
stderr (2) - File descriptor 2, used for output error messages.

Problem 3: What is the significance of 2>&1?

File Descriptors:

In Unix/Linux, processes have three standard file descriptors:
0: Standard Input (stdin)
1: Standard Output (stdout)
2: Standard Error (stderr)

Redirection:

The > operator is used to redirect output to a file or another location. This 2>, it specifically refers to redirecting stderr.
The & symbol with number indicates that a number is a file descriptor  not a file name.

Conclusion:
The 2>&1 means "redirect stderr (file descriptor 2) to the same location as stdout (file descriptor 1)".
